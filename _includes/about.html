                <p class="text-faded">I was an International Baccalaureate student at Anglo European School in Chelmsford. I was able to learn many things by taking on lots of higher and standard level calsses. Furthermore, through the required C.A.S (creative, action, service) electives I was able to help Key Stage 3 students learn programming in Python - which in turn helped me get e firmer grip on programming as I was teaching.

                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">While at University I was able to learn many things either related to my degree, about my peers,and about so much more.
		While studying, I was able to learn how to program in C++, Python and Java, as well as dabbled in Perl. These were languages that were required by the modules covered, but I also took the time to further my understanding of each one and continued to develop projects using them.
		<br/> Furthermore, I took the opportunity to get to know my fellow peers through the Ethical Hacking Society as well as through becoming a Peer Mentor and working with students from various computing degrees at various stages. Also, continuing my growth through the Principal's Award where I was able to undertake workshops and getting to know fellow students more.
