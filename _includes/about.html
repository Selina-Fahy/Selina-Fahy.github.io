                <p class="text-faded">While at University I was able to learn many things either related to my degree, about my peers, about myself, and about so much more.
		While studying, I was able to learn how to program in C++, Python and Java, as well as dabbled in Perl. These were langues that were required by the modules that I took, but I also took the time to further my understanding of each and every one of them and continued to develop projects using them.
		<br/> Furthermore, I took the opportunity to get to know my fellow peers through the Ethical Hacking Society as well as through becoming a Peer Mentor and working with students from various computing degrees as various stages.
